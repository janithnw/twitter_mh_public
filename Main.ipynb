    "-------\n",
    "We use the CLPsych Dataset. The dataset contains a file for each user, in which each file contains JSON objects of the users' tweets. We read these files in, preprocess them and store them as Pandas Dataframes in pickle files.\n",

    "Active Mentions Filtering\n",
    "--------\n",
    "In this step, active mentions of mental health related content are filtered. The related files for this task are in the active_mentions_filtering directory. We use a an SQLLite database to store our manual labels. We used ```labelling_core.py``` and ```labelling_core_ptsd.py``` scripts to manually label tweets. Methods in ```active_mentions_filter.py``` are used to train, and evaluate the learning model that filters tweets. Once there are manually labelled tweets, and once a learning model is trained to identify mental health related tweets, run ```preprocessing/add_active_mentions_probs.py``` to add probability values to the main dataset.\n",
